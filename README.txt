# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to know the different campaigns outcomes in relation to their launch date (successful, failed and canceled) and to visualize the percentage of failed, successful and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In this chart we wanted to determine the outcome of the launch date of the theaters per month. And we could see that the month with more successful and failed theaters was May. The successful and failed theaters follow a similar trend but ON a smaller scale.

June was the month with more canceled theaters, but there was still a small number of cancellations throughout the year.

This analysis was a little bit challenging when creating the pivot tables making sure the information was on the correct section. (values, columns, rows etc..)

Another challenge I faced on the Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the group did not change automatically as mentioned and I needed to look up for another way to include only the months in the pivot table. 



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this chart we wanted to know the percentage of the outcomes based on goals. If the goal for each play was successful, failed or canceled and what percentage we had regarding the expected goal. 


This task was more challenging because I needed to be more cautious when creating the formulas and It took me longer because some of them were manual. Also, when I saw that there were no canceled outcomes I thought I was doing something wrong so I checked them a lot of times to make sure I was correct. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered




## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There was a 54% decrease between May and December.
The theaters increased their successful shows from March to June and from May to September their successful theaters decreased.



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

From 534 projects, 73% were successful in a goal from $1000 to $44999. This was the best successful percentage compared to the number of projects based on goals. 

When the goal was less than $1000 they had 76% of successful plays based on 186 projects. 

The 100% of failed plays was when the goal was between $45000 to $49999


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some of the limitations were that we had to know what was the information we had so I could use the correct formulas in order to make this data clear and easier to analyze. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

For both tables we could use the bar chart because to make it easy to differentiate the information we are evaluating but I think the easier way to demonstrate the information we were using was the line charts we used.
